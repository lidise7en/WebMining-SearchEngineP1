This is a java project called Homework#1-14641

All the java files are in the src folder.All the indices and stoplist.txt,queries.txt,structured_set.txt are in the resource folder.

You can run the main in Parser.java to get the results of unranked retrieval.
I have written 4 patterns of inputs ,including single query, unstructured AND, unstructured OR and structured set. You can see it in the file and i mark it by one line of note.
The output format is the same as online check.

The final results are store in resource/final_result.txt.
Important!!!  You should delete the final_result.txt after EVERY execution since the final_result.txt is append written pattern.

The output format is NOT the same as online check. It is the format in the sample document.You can change to the online check format I have noted in the file. 

The final results are store in resource/final_result.txt.
Important!!!  You should delete the final_result.txt after EVERY execution since the final_result.txt is append written pattern.   

Please ignore the outputs in System.out.println since it is just my test information and useless.

If you have trouble in running my codes, feel free to email me. I promise there is really no problem and it can run successfully.
Thank you for your work!!!
